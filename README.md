# JackTheResumeRipper
The HACK OH/IO (Ohio State University's flagship hackathon) project for team "Meh."
This web app uses Microsoft Azure intellligence technology to rip your resume to shreds before your eyes.

The code in the server folder is not the real backend, but it is a copy of the AWS Lamba functions, meant as an archive.

Tools that are used in this project:
AWS Lambda & API Gateway
Microsoft Azure
Vue.js, Vuetify
